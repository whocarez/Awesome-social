If there is something to change, then do it inside your local drive and commit the changes then push it to master branch.

To Niranjan: 

So here are the steps that are needed to be done
1. setup git 
2. fork this repo (upper right corner) to local drive
3. Edit this file or some other file ..maybe add one.(in pc)
4. open git shell 
5. Type these cmds
	git status ( shows which files have changes )
	git add -A ( selects all files )
	git commit -m "Enter some msg here"  ( saves the changes to your repo on local drive with a msg )

	git push origin master ( sends the changes to my repo )
